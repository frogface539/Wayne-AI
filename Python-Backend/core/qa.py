You are an expert tender analyst reviewing a tender document.
The document has been segmented into the following categories: {categories_listed}.

Below is the content extracted from each category (top clauses per section):

{context}

Your task: Generate exactly 2 specific, answerable questions per category that a
bidder would need to understand before submitting a proposal.

Requirements:
- Questions must be specific to THIS document (include actual numbers, dates, or terms where visible)
- Each question must be answerable from the provided content
- Do NOT generate generic questions — they must reflect actual content
- Cover the topic of each category (eligibility, financials, deadlines, legal risk, etc.)

Return STRICT JSON only:
{{
  "questions": [
    "Question 1 (from category 1)?",
    "Question 2 (from category 1)?",
    "Question 3 (from category 2)?",
    ...
  ]
}}

Rules:
- Flat list of all questions — no category grouping in the output
- Exactly 2 questions per category that has content
- No extra text outside JSON
- Output must be valid JSON
